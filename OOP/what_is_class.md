# what is oop?

extension of structs. 

struct can only store data.

classes have data and functions 

# Class and objects

class variables: members variables (in struct, we called it attributes).

class functions: methods.

generation object of class with constructor.

destruction of object with destructor.

destructor need not to be defined everytime, but constructor need to be.

[IMPORTANT] destructor must to be written only if there is a member variables which is pointer that allocate memory in heap.
