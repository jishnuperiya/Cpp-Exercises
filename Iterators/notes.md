# there are different types of iterators

## forward iterator - start to end . not bakcwards

has only ++ operator not --

## bidirectional iterator - start to end and bakcwards

list has bidirecti√≥nal iterator 

map - bidirectional

operations for bidiretional operators : ++ (go forward)  and -- (go back)

## random access iterator - in vector and array. 

have many operators

i+=n or i-=n : jump n memory locations back or forward (not just one memory)
